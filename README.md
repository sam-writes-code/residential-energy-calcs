### Project name
Heat pump calculations for a residential property

### Project Description
The purpose of this project is to assess the cost-effectiveness of different energy source technologies for a residential property, predominantly for heat but further calculations may look at electricity source as well.

There are several potential options, each with positive and negatives. The motivation of the owner of the property is to reduce bills for the future and reduce carbon footprint, at reasonable overall cost.

Some rough calculations have already been completed. List of investigated technologies are below. This project will begin by doing more in depth calculations for the installation of an air-source heat pump, based on imported weather data and the heat pump's coefficient of performance (COP). Note, the property is not connected to the mains gas line and currently uses kerosene oil stored in an external tank.

Technologies previously investigated are:
1. Biomass boiler
2. Oil (current)
3. Oil (with new high efficiency boiler)
4. LPG
5. BioLPG*
6. Electric boiler

*Doubts have been raised as to whether BioLPG actually has any carbon reduction benefit, as it is unclear whether the 'Bio' comes from plant products or animal waste (the former being carbon neutral and the latter being no different to regular gas, potentially even worse due to the creation of extra methane).
